## Description

An authentication service to be used with the Eclipse PASS project.

## Usage

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn run start
```

## Building

The only build step required is to bundle this service as a Docker image, which can be done with an yarn command:

```
yarn build
```

This will create a new `ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-auth` image with a tag matching the version number in `package.json`
